Ocaml 4.00.0-beta2 - MIPS
=========================

In the new OCaml 4.00 compiler, support for MIPS was jettisoned.
Here it has been reintroduced, as it was in the previous versions
for n32 ABI.

It will be merged into my other ocaml repository once it catch up
with the 4.00 release.


20 years from now, when there will be nothing left from x86 arch
but bad memories, let's hope the MIPS arch and the OCaml language
will still be around!
