Ocaml 4.00.0-beta2 - MIPS + Loongson
====================================

In the new OCaml 4.00 compiler, support for MIPS was jettisoned.
Here it has been reintroduced, as it was in the previous versions
for n32 ABI, plus the few fixes required for the *Loongson*
processor.

It will be merged into my other ocaml repository once it catch up
with the 4.00 release, or into another tree holding even more
backends. So this is temporary.


20 years from now, when there will be nothing left from x86 arch
but bad memories, let's hope the MIPS arch and the OCaml language
will still be around!
